Given a board of size 2n+1 that contains n white marbles and n black marbles separated by a space, our purpose is to reverse this board. Conditions to move any marble are as follows.
1.1 White marble can only go right
• It can move to RHS space,i.e. from "W_" to "_W"
• It can jump over a black marble to RHS space, i.e. from "w b_"to "_b w"
1.2 Black marble can only go left
• It can move to LHS space, i.e. from_" b" to "b_"
• It can jump over awhite marble to LHS space, i.e. from _" w b" to "b w _"

2.1 Ask user for n which is #white and #black marble; n must be at least 2. Create a board of 2n+1 marbles.
Al marbles must be labelled with IDs e.g. wO, w1, b0, b1.
2.2 Keep asking user for marble ID.Check whether the chosen marble is movable. If it is, then move it.At any time, the user must be able to switch to auto mode.
2.3 In auto mode, find a solution (if there is one) starting from the switching state in (2.2).
2.4 The program should be able to loop for a new game with different board size &handle input errors.
